# Creature-Evolution

This is a program written in C++ & SDL2 to simulate evolution. 

At the moment it's just written to get to grips with C++. There is a working rendering system with moveable camera, rendering polygon shapes. 

A messaging and scheduling system has been added. 

To do:
  - Collision detection between entities
  - Add the neural networks to the creatures
  - Add genes to the creatures. They pass down more than just the neural network. Size, speed etc.
